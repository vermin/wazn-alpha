## Introduction

WAZN is a private, secure, untraceable, decentralized digital currency. You are your bank, you control your funds, and nobody can trace your transfers unless you allow them to do so.

**Privacy:** WAZN uses a cryptographically sound system to allow you to send and receive funds without your transactions being easily revealed on the blockchain (the ledger of transactions that everyone has). This ensures that your purchases, receipts, and all transfers remain absolutely private by default.

**Security:** Using the power of a distributed peer-to-peer consensus network, every transaction on the network is cryptographically secured. Individual wallets have a 25 word mnemonic seed that is only displayed once, and can be written down to backup the wallet. Wallet files are encrypted with a passphrase to ensure they are useless if stolen.

**Untraceability:** By taking advantage of ring signatures, a special property of a certain type of cryptography, WAZN is able to ensure that transactions are not only untraceable, but have an optional measure of ambiguity that ensures that transactions cannot easily be tied back to an individual user or computer.

## About this project

This is the core implementation of WAZN. It is open source and completely free to use without restrictions, except for those specified in the license agreement above. There are no restrictions on anyone creating an alternative implementation of WAZN that uses the protocol and network in a compatible manner.

As with many development projects, the repository on Github is considered to be the "staging" area for the latest changes. Before changes are merged into that branch on the main repository, they are tested by individual developers in their own branches, submitted as a pull request, and then subsequently tested by contributors who focus on testing and code reviews. That having been said, the repository should be carefully considered before using it in a production environment, unless there is a patch in the repository for a particular show-stopping issue you are experiencing. It is generally a better idea to use a tagged release for stability.

**Anyone is welcome to contribute to WAZN's codebase!** If you have a fix or code change, feel free to submit it as a pull request directly to the "master" branch. In cases where the change is relatively small or does not affect other parts of the codebase it may be merged in immediately by any one of the collaborators. On the other hand, if the change is particularly large or complex, it is expected that it will be discussed at length either well in advance of the pull request being submitted, or even directly on the pull request.

## Contributing

If you want to help out, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) for a set of guidelines.

## Scheduled software upgrades

WAZN uses a fixed-schedule software upgrade (hard fork) mechanism to implement new features. This means that end users and service providers of WAZN should run current versions and upgrade their software on a regular schedule. Regular software upgrades are planned up to 2 times a year and they should take place in March or September. Nonessential or surface software revisions will be available as they are through testing process. The required software for these upgrades will be available prior to the scheduled date. Please check WAZN official repository before this date for appropriate software version. Below is the projected schedule for the next upgrade. Dates are provided in YYYY-MM-DD format.

| Software block upgrade height | Date & Time GMT***   | Recommended App version | Minimum App version | Modification details   |
| ----------------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| v10 -> 1                      | 2019-11-09 23:16     | v1.0.1                  | v1.0.0              | cn-wazn 128KB          |

* XXs indicate that these details have not been determined as of commit date.
* *** indicates approximate time of anticipated WAZN block mined to complete the upgrade process.

## Release staging schedule and protocol

Approximately 8 weeks before a scheduled software upgrade, a branch from **dev** [github.com/vermin/wazn](https://github.com/vermin/wazn) will be created with the new release version tag. Pull requests that address bugs should then be made to both, the Dev and the **new release branch**. Pull requests that require extensive review and testing (generally, optimizations and new features) should *not* be made to the release branch. New version will pushed to [github.com/project-wazn/wazn](https://github.com/project-wazn/wazn) **master** branch, release created and binaries will be made available to public.

## Compiling WAZN from source

### Dependencies

The following table summarizes the tools and libraries required to build. A few of the libraries are also included in this repository (marked as "Vendored"). By default, the build uses the library installed on the system, and ignores the vendored sources. However, if no library is found installed on the system, then the vendored source will be built and used. The vendored sources are also used for statically-linked builds because distribution packages often include only shared library binaries (`.so`) but not static library archives (`.a`).

Debian / Ubuntu one liner for all dependencies:  
``` sudo apt update && sudo apt install git build-essential cmake libboost-all-dev miniupnpc libunbound-dev graphviz doxygen libunwind8-dev pkg-config libssl-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libreadline-dev libzmq3-dev libsodium-dev libhidapi-dev libhidapi-libusb0 liblzma-dev libexpat1-dev libpgm-dev libldns-dev libreadline6-dev qttools5-dev-tools libusb-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler ```

[1] On Debian/Ubuntu `libgtest-dev` only includes sources and headers. You must build the library binary manually. This can be done with the following command ```sudo apt-get install libgtest-dev && cd /usr/src/gtest && sudo cmake . && sudo make && sudo mv libg* /usr/lib/```  
[2] libnorm-dev is needed if your zmq library was built with libnorm, and not needed otherwise

Install all dependencies at once on macOS with the provided Brewfile:
``` brew update && brew bundle --file=contrib/brew/Brewfile ```

FreeBSD one liner for required to build dependencies
```pkg install git gmake cmake pkgconf boost-libs cppzmq libsodium```

### Cloning the repository

Clone recursively to pull-in needed submodule(s):

`$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/project-wazn/wazn`

If you already have a repo cloned, initialize and update:

`$ cd wazn && git submodule init && git submodule update`

### Build instructions

WAZN uses the CMake build system and a top-level [Makefile](Makefile) that invokes cmake commands as needed.

### Linux & macOS

* Install the dependencies
* Change to the root of the source code directory and build:

        cd wazn
        USE_SINGLE_BUILDDIR=1 make release

*Optional*: If your machine has several cores and enough memory, enable parallel build by running `make -j<number of threads>` instead of `make`. For this to be worthwhile, the machine should have one core and about 2GB of RAM available per thread.

*Note*: If cmake can not find zmq.hpp file on OS X, installing `zmq.hpp` from https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq to `/usr/local/include` should fix that error.

*Note*: The instructions above will compile the most stable release of the WAZN software. If you would like to use and test the most recent software, use ```git checkout master```. The master branch may contain updates that are both unstable and incompatible with release software, though testing is always encouraged. If you would like to checkout the most stable branch, please use ```git checkout stable```.

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* Add `PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wazn/build/release/bin"` to `.profile`

* Run WAZN with `waznd --detach`

* **Optional**: build and run the test suite to verify the binaries:

        make release-test

    *NOTE*: `core_tests` test may take a few hours to complete.

* **Optional**: to build binaries suitable for debugging:

         make debug

* **Optional**: to build statically-linked binaries:

         make release-static

Dependencies need to be built with -fPIC. Static libraries usually aren't, so you may have to build them yourself with -fPIC. Refer to their documentation for how to build them.

* **Optional**: build documentation in `doc/html` (omit `HAVE_DOT=YES` if `graphviz` is not installed):

        HAVE_DOT=YES doxygen Doxyfile

### Windows:

Binaries for Windows are built on Windows using the MinGW toolchain within
[MSYS2 environment](https://www.msys2.org). The MSYS2 environment emulates a
POSIX system. The toolchain runs within the environment and *cross-compiles*
binaries that can run outside of the environment as a regular Windows
application.

**Preparing the build environment**

* Download and install the [MSYS2 installer](https://www.msys2.org), either the 64-bit or the 32-bit package, depending on your system.
* Open the MSYS shell via the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut
* Update packages using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu

* Exit the MSYS shell using Alt+F4  
* Edit the properties for the `MSYS2 Shell` shortcut changing "msys2_shell.bat" to "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw64" for 64-bit builds or "msys2_shell.cmd -mingw32" for 32-bit builds
* Restart MSYS shell via modified shortcut and update packages again using pacman:  

        pacman -Syuu

* Install dependencies:

To build for 64-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain make mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-boost mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl mingw-w64-x86_64-zeromq mingw-w64-x86_64-libsodium mingw-w64-x86_64-hidapi

To build for 32-bit Windows:

        pacman -S mingw-w64-i686-toolchain make mingw-w64-i686-cmake mingw-w64-i686-boost mingw-w64-i686-openssl mingw-w64-i686-zeromq mingw-w64-i686-libsodium mingw-w64-i686-hidapi

* Open the MingW shell via `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 64-bit Windows
  or `MinGW-w64-Win64 Shell` shortcut on 32-bit Windows. Note that if you are
  running 64-bit Windows, you will have both 64-bit and 32-bit MinGW shells.

**Cloning**

* To git clone, run:

        git clone --recursive https://github.com/project-wazn/wazn

**Building**

* Change to the cloned directory, run:

        cd wazn

* If you would like a specific [version/tag](https://github.com/project-wazn/wazn/tags), do a git checkout for that version. eg. 'v1.0.1'. If you don't care about the version and just want binaries from master, skip this step:

        git checkout stable

* If you are on a 64-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win64

* If you are on a 32-bit system, run:

        make release-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/release/bin`

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 64-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win64

* **Optional**: to build Windows binaries suitable for debugging on a 32-bit system, run:

        make debug-static-win32

* The resulting executables can be found in `build/debug/bin`

### On Linux for Android (using docker):

        # Build image (for ARM 32-bit)
        docker build -f utils/build_scripts/android32.Dockerfile -t wazn-droid .
        # Build image (for ARM 64-bit)
        docker build -f utils/build_scripts/android64.Dockerfile -t wazn-droid .
        # Create container
        docker create -it --name wazn-droid wazn-droid bash
        # Get binaries
        docker cp wazn-droid:/src/build/release/bin .

### Building portable statically linked binaries (Cross Compiling)

By default, in either dynamically or statically linked builds, binaries target the specific host processor on which the build happens and are not portable to other processors. Portable binaries can be built using the following targets:

* ```make release-static-linux-x86_64``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 portable across POSIX systems on x86_64 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-i686``` builds binaries on Linux on x86_64 or i686 portable across POSIX systems on i686 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv8``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv8 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv7``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv7 processors
* ```make release-static-linux-armv6``` builds binaries on Linux portable across POSIX systems on armv6 processors
* ```make release-static-win64``` builds binaries on 64-bit Windows portable across 64-bit Windows systems
* ```make release-static-win32``` builds binaries on 64-bit or 32-bit Windows portable across 32-bit Windows systems

### Cross Compiling

You can also cross-compile static binaries on Linux for Windows and macOS with the `depends` system.

* ```make depends target=x86_64-linux-gnu``` for 64-bit linux binaries.  
* ```make depends target=x86_64-w64-mingw32``` for 64-bit windows binaries. Requires: python3 g++-mingw-w64-x86-64 wine1.6 bc  
* ```make depends target=x86_64-apple-darwin11``` for macOS binaries. Requires: cmake imagemagick libcap-dev librsvg2-bin libz-dev libbz2-dev libtiff-tools python-dev  
* ```make depends target=i686-linux-gnu``` for 32-bit linux binaries. Requires: g++-multilib bc  
* ```make depends target=i686-w64-mingw32``` for 32-bit windows binaries. Requires: python3 g++-mingw-w64-i686  
* ```make depends target=arm-linux-gnueabihf``` for armv7 binaries. Requires: g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf  
* ```make depends target=aarch64-linux-gnu``` for armv8 binaries. Requires: g++-aarch64-linux-gnu

The required packages are the names for each toolchain on apt. Depending on your distro, they may have different names.

Using `depends` might also be easier to compile WAZN on Windows than using MSYS. Activate Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) with a distro (for example Ubuntu), install the apt build-essentials and follow the `depends` steps as depicted above.

The produced binaries still link libc dynamically. If the binary is compiled on a current distribution, it might not run on an older distribution with an older installation of libc. Passing `-DBACKCOMPAT=ON` to cmake will make sure that the binary will run on systems having at least libc version 2.17.

## Running waznd

The build places the binary in `bin/` sub-directory within the build directory from which cmake was invoked (repository root by default). To run in foreground:

    ./bin/waznd

To list all available options, run `./bin/waznd --help`. Options can be specified either on the command line or in a configuration file passed by the `--config-file` argument.  To specify an option in the configuration file, add a line with the syntax `argumentname=value`, where `argumentname` is the name of the argument without the leading dashes, for example `log-level=1`.

To run in background:

    ./bin/waznd --log-file waznd.log --detach

To run as a systemd service, copy
[waznd.service](utils/systemd/waznd.service) to `/etc/systemd/system/` and [waznd.conf](utils/conf/waznd.conf) to `/etc/`. The [exampleservice](utils/systemd/waznd.service) assumes that the user `wazn` exists and its home is the data directory specified in the [exampleconfig](utils/conf/waznd.conf).

If you're on Mac, you may need to add the `--max-concurrency 1` option to wazn-wallet-cli, and possibly waznd, if you get crashes refreshing.

## Internationalization

See [README.i18n.md](README.i18n.md).

## Using Tor

> There is a new, experimental integration with Tor. The feature allows connecting over IPv4 and Tor simultaneously - IPv4 is used forelaying blocks and relaying transactions received by peers whereas Tor is used solely for relaying transactions received over local RPC. This provides privacy and better protection against surrounding node (sybil) attacks.

While WAZN isn't made to integrate with Tor, it can be used wrapped with torsocks, by setting the following configuration parameters and environment variables:

* `--p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1` on the command line or `p2p-bind-ip=127.0.0.1` in waznd.conf to disable listening for connections on external interfaces.
* `--no-igd` on the command line or `no-igd=1` in waznd.conf to disable IGD (UPnP port forwarding negotiation), which is pointless with Tor.
* `DNS_PUBLIC=tcp` or `DNS_PUBLIC=tcp://x.x.x.x` where x.x.x.x is the IP of the desired DNS server, for DNS requests to go over TCP, so that they are routed through Tor. When IP is not specified, waznd uses the default list of servers defined in [src/common/dns_utils.cpp](src/common/dns_utils.cpp).
* `TORSOCKS_ALLOW_INBOUND=1` to tell torsocks to allow waznd to bind to interfaces to accept connections from the wallet. On some Linux systems, torsocks allows binding to localhost by default, so setting this variable is only necessary to allow binding to local LAN/VPN interfaces to allow wallets to connect from remote hosts. On other systems, it may be needed for local wallets as well.
* Do NOT pass `--detach` when running through torsocks with systemd, (see [utils/systemd/waznd.service](utils/systemd/waznd.service) for details).
* If you use the wallet with a Tor daemon via the loopback IP (eg, 127.0.0.1:9050), then use `--untrusted-daemon` unless it is your own hidden service.

Example command line to start waznd through Tor:

    DNS_PUBLIC=tcp torsocks waznd --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd

### Using Tor on Tails

TAILS ships with a very restrictive set of firewall rules. Therefore, you need to add a rule to allow this connection too, in addition to telling torsocks to allow inbound connections. Full example:

    sudo iptables -I OUTPUT 2 -p tcp -d 127.0.0.1 -m tcp --dport 11787 -j ACCEPT
    DNS_PUBLIC=tcp torsocks ./waznd --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --no-igd --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 \
        --data-dir /home/amnesia/Persistent/your/directory/to/the/blockchain

# Known Issues

### Socket-based

Because of the nature of the socket-based protocols that drive WAZN blockchain, certain protocol weaknesses are somewhat unavoidable at this time. While these weaknesses can theoretically be fully mitigated, the effort required may not justify the ends. As such, please consider taking the following precautions if you are a WAZN node operator:

- Run `waznd` on a "secured" machine. If operational security is not your forte, at a very minimum, have a dedicated computer running `waznd` and **do not** browse the web, use email clients, or use any other potentially harmful apps on your `waznd` machine. **Do not click links or load URL/MUA content on the same machine**. Doing so may potentially exploit weaknesses in commands which accept "localhost" and "127.0.0.1".
- If you plan on hosting a public "remote" node, start `waznd` with `--restricted-rpc`. This is a must.

### Blockchain-based

Certain blockchain "features" can be considered "bugs" if misused correctly. Consequently, please consider the following:

- When receiving WAZN, be aware that it may be locked for an arbitrary time if the sender elected to, preventing you from spending that WAZN until the lock time expires. You may want to hold off acting upon such a transaction until the unlock time lapses. To get a sense of that time, you can consider the remaining block time until unlock as seen in the `show_transfers` command.
